				{"text":"Eating Salt will cure a Vampire bite. Wearing Gold or a Flower Crown prevents bites altogether."},
				{"text":"Most leaf types drop a unique fruit, each with unique recipes. Every fruit combined makes a Fruit Salad, equivalent to a Golden Apple."},
				{"text":"Placed dyeable blocks can be painted with a Brush in one hand and Paint in the other."},
